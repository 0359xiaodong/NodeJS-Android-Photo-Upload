Android Multipart Upload to Node.js
===================================

This is one of many ways to create a photo upload service using Node.js and Android. I belive there is a lot of more improvement work to be done to handle errors in the server-side.

This repo contains both the Android app and the Node.js server sources, they are in two separaed folders.

The folders are:
* App - This is the Android App
* Server - This is the Node.js Server
